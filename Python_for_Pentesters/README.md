# Python for Pentesters

This is a writeup or rather the code I wrote to solve the challenges in
the [Python for Pentesters room](https://tryhackme.com/room/pythonforcybersecurity).

Most functionality is implemented in `thm_pythonforpentesters_lib.py`
which is just imported by the other files to do their job.
